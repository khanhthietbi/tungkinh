# Tung kinh app by Khanhthietbi

This application is based on php-getting-started barebone with composer modification. I removed all redundant component to make it as clean and fast as possible.

Original project can be found on [Getting Started with PHP on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php) article.
